# This script prompts the user for two integers and prints their sum.
x = int(input("what is x? "))
y = int(input("what is y? "))

## Compare the two integers and print a message based on their relationship.

if x < y:
    #if x is less than y, print a message
    print(f"{x} is less than {y}")
    
elif x > y:
    #if x is greater than y, print a message
    print(f"{c} is greater than {y} ")
else:
    #if x is equal to y, print a message
    print(f"{x} is equal to {y}")
